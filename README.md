# Libft
[Libft](subject/libft.en.pdf) is an individual project at Codam College (42 network) where we are asked to re-write specific C Standard library functions. We are also encouraged to write additional/bonus functions of our choice that we think they might be useful for our future projects.

# Compiling
Clone the repository and compile the project with one of the following commands :

``` $ make```  

or

``` $ make re```  


# Usage
You can now create your own main and use any function from libft.a 

# Challenges
The main challenges of this project were the following :
- Fully understand how every C library function works and thus be able re-create it.
- Test thoroughly every function and with different edge cases to confirm that it behaves as expected (same as the original one).

# Takeaways
By completing this project I learned :
- In detail how some of the main C library functions work
- How to create my first static library (libft.a)
